# Scientific Calculator

A Java-based GUI Scientific Calculator built using the Swing framework. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, as well as more advanced scientific functions like trigonometric operations, logarithms, and exponents. It also provides error handling and input parsing features such as parentheses, handling of negative numbers, and backspace functionality.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- **Scientific Functions**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `exp`.
- **Parentheses**: Allows grouping of expressions using `(` and `)` for complex calculations.
- **Negative Numbers**: Proper handling of negative numbers with a `neg` button.
- **Backspace Function**: Allows removal of the last character using the "Back" button.
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Math Error" for division by zero and "Error" for other invalid inputs.
- **GUI Design**: Uses Java Swing with a simple and intuitive grid layout.
